# Welcome to SpaceTraders

SpaceTraders is a terminal game inspired by the combination of classics like Taipan and TradeWars.

You start off as a regular trader with startup capital from various potential sources (debt from bank or a local syndicate, or a slow grind starting with minimal funds), and move your way up to a more profitable enterprise,  more resources, and a growing ability to upgrade your ship and acquire assets towards wealth and power.

## About the Game
This is starting off as a mini game (and minimum viable product) that just works, works minimally, and openly ended with separate files for views, data and language; ready for adaptation to other formats down the road.

## Flow

While the focal point is about the ship (the primary vehicle for the player, both literally and figuratively), much of the activity is made when landed. By "landed" the context is any destination such as biomes (planet, moon) or artificial construct (like a spaceport) where activities such as trading and banking can be made.
